Frontend Task — Referral Module (Vue 3 + Pinia + Tailwind)
Goal: Build the Referral page (user only). Must support Dark Mode and Mobile/Desktop. No
real API — use Pinia + mock service but keep it API-ready.
Scope
Route: /referrals
Sections:
• CopyReferralLink (code + full URL + copy feedback)
• PointsBalanceCard (current + lifetime points)
• ReferralHistoryTable (search, status filter, pagination, loading/empty/error)
• Add Referral via GlobalDrawer → ReferralForm (name, email, optional phone)
Tech
Vue 3, Pinia, Vue Router, Tailwind (dark class), Vite
TypeScript preferred; no UI libs (icons OK)
State & Mock
Pinia stores: referral.store, points.store
Mock service (api.service.ts) with 300–800ms latency:
• getMyProfile, getMyHistory, postManual, getPoints
Rules in mock: duplicate email → 409; new referral starts as pending
Seed 15–25 items (mixed statuses, realistic dates)
Components
GlobalDrawer.vue (reusable: v-model, title, size, side, header/footer slots)
CopyReferralLink.vue (tooltip/toast “Copied!”)
ReferralForm.vue (HTML5 validation; normalize +880; success resets + closes drawer)
ReferralHistoryTable.vue (mobile cards, desktop table with sticky header)
PointsBalanceCard.vue (plus small static indicator)
Dark Mode & UX
Toggle in header; persist to localStorage; toggle html.dark

Accessible focus states, labeled inputs, drawer focus-trap, ESC/backdrop close
Acceptance
Copy works with visible feedback
Manual submit validates + blocks duplicate email
List supports search, filter, pagination with loading/empty/error
Pixel-clean spacing/typography per Figma; full dark mode parity
No console errors; clean component structure; API-ready (service abstraction)
Submission
Submission Deadline: 20-10-2025 (Asia/Dhaka) by 23:59.
Repository: Public GitHub repo is REQUIRED (no private links). Include clear commit
history.
Live Preview: Vercel/Netlify preferred, or provide `vite preview` steps in README.
README must include: run steps, toggle mock error/latency, how to swap to real API.
